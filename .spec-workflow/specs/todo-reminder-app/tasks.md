  - Files: lib/screens/settings.dart (update), lib/services/privacy_prefs.dart
  - _Prompt:
    Implement the task for spec todo-reminder-app, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task:

    Success: CI pipeline passes tests.

  - [ ] Task 13: Repeat controller for readout
    - Files: lib/services/repeat_controller.dart, test/repeat_controller_test.dart
    - _Prompt:
      Implement the task for spec todo-reminder-app, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task:
      Role: Flutter developer
      Task: Implement a repeat controller that manages repeated TTS readouts for a task. It should support start, stop, pause, resume, configurable interval (default 20s), and a cap (max duration or max repeats). Persist minimal state so that short-term process restarts can potentially restore active repeats.
      Restrictions: Keep logic platform-agnostic; platform-specific execution (foreground service) handled in separate task.
      _Leverage: design.md
      _Requirements: Repeat every 20s until stopped, configurable cap
      Success: Unit tests verify start/stop/interval/cap behavior.

  - [ ] Task 14: Android foreground service for reliable readout
    - Files: android/src/main/... (native service), lib/services/android_foreground_bridge.dart
    - _Prompt:
      Implement the task for spec todo-reminder-app, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task:
      Role: Android engineer
      Task: Implement a minimal Android foreground service (or integrate a package that provides it) to run TTS readouts reliably while the app is backgrounded or device is idle. Expose start/stop APIs to Dart via platform channels or a supporting plugin. Provide persistent notification with Stop/Mark Done actions while running.
      Restrictions: Keep native code minimal and documented; ensure proper permission and foreground notification handling per Android versions.
      _Leverage: design.md, notification_service
      _Requirements: Reliable repeating TTS on Android background
      Success: Manual test on Android demonstrates repeated readout while app is backgrounded and Stop action works.

  - [ ] Task 15: iOS fallback approach for readout when backgrounded
    - Files: lib/services/ios_readout_fallback.dart, README.md (platform limitations doc)
    - _Prompt:
      Implement the task for spec todo-reminder-app, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task:
      Role: iOS engineer
      Task: Implement the documented fallback for iOS: when the app is backgrounded/terminated, schedule repeated local notifications up to the configured cap; when the app is foregrounded, resume TTS readout via repeat controller. Document any Background Modes implications and user-visible limitations in README.md.
      Restrictions: Avoid using background audio mode unless team explicitly opts in after reviewing App Store implications.
      _Leverage: design.md
      _Requirements: iOS-compatible fallback for repeated readout
      Success: Manual test on iOS demonstrates fallback behavior and documentation covers limitations.

  - [ ] Task 16: Repeat readout settings & DND handling
    - Files: lib/screens/settings.dart (update), lib/services/dnd_manager.dart
    - _Prompt:
      Implement the task for spec todo-reminder-app, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task:
      Role: Flutter developer
      Task: Add Settings for repeat cap (e.g., default 5 minutes), allow user to opt-in to allow audible readout during DND, and implement a DND manager that queries system DND status where possible and enforces respect/default behavior.
      Restrictions: Do not override system DND without explicit consent.
      _Leverage: design.md
      _Requirements: Configurable cap, DND respect with opt-in
      Success: Manual test toggling settings changes how repeated readouts behave with system DND.

  - [ ] Task 17: Tests for repeated readout integration
    - Files: test/integration/repeat_integration_test.dart, test/manual_instructions.md
    - _Prompt:
      Implement the task for spec todo-reminder-app, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task:
      Role: QA
      Task: Add integration tests for the repeat controller and provide manual device test instructions for Android foreground service and iOS fallback (since CI cannot run device-level background tests reliably).
      Restrictions: Keep CI-friendly tests for unit/integration; include manual steps for device verification.
      _Leverage: repeat_controller, android_foreground_bridge, ios_readout_fallback
      _Requirements: Repeat behavior verified and documented
      Success: Unit/integration tests pass in CI; manual instructions validate device behaviors.
