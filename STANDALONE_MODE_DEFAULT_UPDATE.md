# Update: Standalone Mode Now Default

## Summary
Changed the default setting for Standalone Mode from `false` to `true`, making the app start in offline-only mode by default.

## Changes Made

### 1. SettingsService (`lib/services/settings_service.dart`)
- Updated `standaloneMode` getter default value from `false` to `true`

### 2. Settings Screen (`lib/screens/settings.dart`)  
- Updated `_standaloneMode` initial value from `false` to `true`
- Updated `initState()` to use `defaultValue: true` for standaloneMode

### 3. Home Screen (`lib/screens/home.dart`)
- Updated `_standaloneMode` initial value from `false` to `true`

### 4. Documentation (`STANDALONE_MODE_FEATURE.md`)
- Updated to reflect that standalone mode is now the default behavior
- Revised user experience descriptions and usage instructions

## Impact

### For New Users
- App starts with a clean, simplified interface (no login button visible)
- Works completely offline by default
- Focus on core task management without cloud sync distraction

### For Existing Users
- Those who already have the setting configured will keep their preference
- Only affects users who haven't explicitly set the standalone mode preference
- Can still toggle to enable online features if desired
